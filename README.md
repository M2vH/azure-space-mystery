## Your Mission

Help! The International Space Station has sent out a distress call. A part of its solar array has been knocked off and it's losing power fast. Can you help retrieve the parts and deliver them to the ISS to save the day? To do so, you'll need to consult with some very special women scientists. Collect the clues they provide, solve the puzzles they offer, and achieve your mission!
