# üìù Azure Space Mystery: Community Localization 

The Azure Space Mystery builds on the success of the Azure Mystery Mansion and the Azure Maya Mystery, text-based games to explore mysteries and interesting facts and learn about technology. With the Azure Space Mystery edition, everyone will have fun and learn about space engineering, space inventions/discoveries and women in tech.
