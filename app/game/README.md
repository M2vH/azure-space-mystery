# Base - Welcome, explorer!

You have been traveling through space, on a mission to join the International Space Station. The astronauts there await the arrival of supplies from your ship.

According to your coordinates, however, you are badly lost! Suddenly, your console lights up and a button turns red and starts beeping. A switch glows an eerie blue. And a handle seems like it needs to be pulled.

<Page url="/rocket/en/1a" instructions="" action="Press the button" condition="none" />

<Page url="/rocket/en/2a" instructions="" action="Flip the blue switch" condition="none" />
<Page url="/rocket/en/3a" instructions="" action="Pull the handle" condition="none" />
