# Collect some rocks

You extend the arm and scoop up some rocks with the help of a magnet. Very interesting specimens!

Unfortunately, collecting the samples has caused your robotic arm to be bent out of shape, as it was hit by the flying rocks. You can't seem to retract it.

Looks like you need to do a space walk to fix it.
