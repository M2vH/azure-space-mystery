# Space walk

You put on a spacesuit. You step outside the rocket and almost stop breathing. You are blown away by the beauty of earth’s Aurora Borealis, the flickering crown of light around the pole.  

While you are working on the fuel tank, your grease gun explodes, getting the dark grey substance all over your helmet, camera, and gloves.

“darn...what else can go wrong on this mission” you mumble to yourself. As you are wiping it off your gloves, the tool bag slips out of your grip! You are about to lose all your tools!  

You caught the tool bag with your fingertips in the last second before it floated off.

What is clinging to the tool bag? It is a _gimbal_, a piece from the ISS solar array wing.
