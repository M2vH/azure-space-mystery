# Space walk

You gather your gear for the repair and put on your space suit, open the hatch, and start your space walk.  

Just as you are nearly finished with your repair, your grease gun explodes. Oil covers your helmet, camera, and gloves.

“Darn...what else can go wrong on this mission” you mumble to yourself. As you are wiping it off your gloves, the tool bag slips out of your grip! You are about to lose all your tools!  

You make a wild grab and catch the tool bag at the last second before it floats off.

What is clinging to the tool bag? It is a _gimbal_, a piece from the ISS solar array wing.

In spite of everything, your mission is complete!
