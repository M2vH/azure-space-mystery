# Geomagnetic storm

After a good nights sleep you get ready to gear up and do a space walk. Once in your suit you climb out the hatch and begin the repair work.

Suddenly the heads up display on your helmet starts blinking read, warning warning.. Incoming..., it's cut short by _static noise_ and a few seconds later the display in your helmet goes out. You try to get back to the ship but your booster rockets won't work either..

You sure are in trouble now...

...your mission is over!
