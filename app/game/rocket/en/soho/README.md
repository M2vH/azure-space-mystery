# Mission: Soho, 2020-09-27

During a regular spaceship check, you discover minor damage to the fuel tank. You realize you need to carry out a space walk for the repair. Your thinking you can carry out a walk in the morning. Regardless, you're going to bed now, too late for a badger to be out and about.

Space walks are safe though right, what could happen, an "alien" ? ;) Maybe I should ask someone or something?

I should listen to the helper about a specific date.

or you can attempt a space walk the next day..
