# Mission: Soho

You are just finishing your lunch when you hear a series of sharp noises.

Looking out of your window, you see oddly-shaped objects whizzing by your spaceship. Looks like you are flying into a small cluster of floating space rocks, or meteroids. It looks like they are hitting your ship.

You hear a voice behind you.
