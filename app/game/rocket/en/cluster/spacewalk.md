# Space walk

You gear up in one of the new space suits borrowed from the [Artemis program](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-python-nasa/2-artemis). Then you crawl out the hatch of the ship and get to work, large swathes of cardboard first, followed by an aluminium cover.

Finally you step back in via the hatch back into the ship and wait for the wave to hit.

The only light you see is from the earth like a blue pearl in a dark cosmos.

Minutes pass until suddenly you feel the tremors gently shaking the ship. A minute or so later, all shaking comes to an end. You try tapping on your wrist computer, nothing. Has it all been for nothing?

You hit the main switch for the ship's system, nothing, you try it again.. the red dot from the ships computer. Joy!

_Hello badger, where to?_

Set course to the solar panels, engage!
