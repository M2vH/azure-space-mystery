# Powering down

The ship gives off a low hum as system after system is powering down. The cabin is dark. The only light you see is from the earth like a blue pearl in a dark cosmos.

Minutes pass until suddenly you feel the tremors gently shaking the ship. A minute or so later, all shaking comes to an end. You try tapping on your wrist computer, nothing.

You hit the main switch for the ship's system, nothing, no power.

_I knew I should have told the repair team to include that EMP shield._

You realize you're now just a tin can, floating through space.

...your mission is over!
