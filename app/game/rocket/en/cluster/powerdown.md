# Powering down

The ship gives off a low hum as system after system powers down. The cabin is dark. The only light you see is from the earth like a blue pearl in a dark cosmos.

Minutes pass until suddenly you feel the tremors gently shaking the ship. A minute or so later, all shaking comes to an end. You try tapping on your wrist computer, but there's no response.

You flip the main switch for the ship's system on, then off, then on. No power.

_I knew I should have told the repair team to include that shield._

You realize you're now just a tin can, floating through space.

...your mission is over!
