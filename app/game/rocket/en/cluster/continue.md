_Well done my young student, you bring honour to badgers everywhere._

Thank you, now what's the solution, P L E A S E

_Why you had the solution in you all this time. You just need to remember your training, the hologram of Hypatia fizzles out_

Wait, come back... something comes to you, boot camp space cadet training, I know this.. 

_Sergeant Meles said, the best way to protect against EMP is layer what you want to protect in card board and aluminum._

Where am I going to find all that, you rummage around all the compartments of the ship until you find large pieces of card boards from the packing crates and a very large roll of aluminum. Oh yes!

It's time for another space walk.
