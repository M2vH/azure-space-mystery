# Beep!

Your sensor has identified a jumble of something floating nearby. "Oh good, at least one simple mission!", you think. "I'll just go pick that up."

You set course towards the object. Suddenly your sensor beeps in a confused way. Something is happening to the object, and it starts to wiggle in a strange way.

You hear a voice behind you.
