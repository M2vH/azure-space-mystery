# Beep!

Your sensor has identified one of the panels floating nearby. "Oh good, at least one simple mission!", you think.

You set course towards the panel. Suddenly your entire display lights up: all the systems start beeping in unison, on high alert. The ship's computer suddenly speaks:

_Warning! Warning! Incoming Solar Eruption_

You hear a voice behind you.

Time is running short! You can either humour Hypatia:

Or you can try to power down the ship, hoping that will protect anything electronic as the electromagnetic wave hits. It's true that the latest models of this ship do have a shield against these disruptive pulses, but you can't remember if that was installed when the ship was last in for service.
