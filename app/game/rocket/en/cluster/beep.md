# Investigate beep

It seems the solar panels have been located. Oh good, at least one simple mission you think.

You set course towards the panels... Just a few minutes later all systems starts beeping in unison, on high alert. The ships computer resounds:

_Warning warning, incoming Solar Eruption_

You hear a voice behind you.

Or you can try power down the ship, hoping that will protect anything electronic as the EMP wave hits. It's a risk though, the latest models of this ship does have an EMP wave shield, but you can't remember if that was installed when the ship was last in for service and repairs.
