# Mission: Cluster

You prepare yourself for your next mission by checking the instruments in the cockpit. Although they all seem in working order, some are dials or spinners with analogue displays, and some are digital, with glowing numeric displays.

You find yourself staring out into cosmos for a second. Far far out there is the Orion Nebula, a cluster where stars are born.

You awake from your daydreaming by a sudden beep from one of your instruments.
