# Mission: Cluster

You prepare yourself for your next mission by checking your ship's instruments panel. All systems appear to be functional.

You scan your sensor displays to see if any part of the missing solar array wing is in the vicinity.

Suddenly, you hear a beep from one of your instruments.
