# To the Ion Tail

Your ship passes the ion tail and a blue shimmer lights up the cabin. Caroline Herschel nods with approval.

_"Good choice. The **ion tail** allows us to pass without harm. Did you know it's also called the **gas tail**?"_

She points at the comet, saying:

_"The **dust tail** is that yellow trail to your upper right. Passing through it would surely have meant trouble for the engines."_

You realize you narrowly escaped a massive engine failure.

Suddenly Caroline cries out!

_"You're not in the clear yet! We need to steer away from the comet itself. Quickly, make an evasive maneuver!"_

You grab the steering column:

<Page url="down"  action="Steer down" condition="none" />
<Page url="continue"  action="Steer left" condition="none" />
