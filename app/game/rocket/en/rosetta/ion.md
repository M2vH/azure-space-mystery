# To the Ion Tail

Your ship passes the ion tail and a blue shimmer lights up the cabin. Caroline Herschel nods with approval.

_"Good choice, the ion tail, allows us to pass without harm. Did you know it's also called "the gas tail"?_

Caroline Herschel points at the comet saying:

_The _dust tail_ is that big yellow thing to your upper right and would surely have meant trouble for the engines._

You realize you narrowingly escaped a massive engine failure. - Phew

_Did you know the _ion tail_ always points away from the sun?_

You listen and nod with interest when suddenly..

_You're not in the clear yet, Caroline suddenly cries out. We need to steer away from the comet itself. Quickly, make an evasive maneuver!_

You grab the steering and you..
