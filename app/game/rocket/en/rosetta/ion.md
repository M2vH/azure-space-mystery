# To the Ion Tail

Your ship passes the ion tail and a blue shimmer lights up the cabin. Caroline Herschel nods with approval.

_"Good choice. The **ion tail** allows us to pass without harm. Did you know it's also called "the **gas tail**"?_

She points at the comet, saying:

_The **dust tail** is that big yellow thing to your upper right and would surely have meant trouble for the engines._

You realize you narrowly escaped a massive engine failure.

_Did you know the ion tail always points away from the sun?_

You listen and nod with interest when suddenly Caroline cries out!

_You're not in the clear yet! We need to steer away from the comet itself. Quickly, make an evasive maneuver!_

You grab the steering column:

<Page url="down"  action="Steer down" condition="none" />
<Page url="continue"  action="Steer left" condition="none" />
