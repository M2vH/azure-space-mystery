# Collision

Too late, you discover your mistake. The ship is on a collision course with the comet. You realize it's too late to make any more maneuvers. You press the eject button and the top part of the ship disconnects and forms an escape pod.

As you look out from the escape pod, you see the remainder of your spaceship disintegrate towards the comets hard surface.

At least you lived to fight another day.

...your mission is over!
