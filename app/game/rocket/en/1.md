# A Message

You press the button, and a screen flickers, then lights up. A shadowy figure looms into focus. 

"Why have you entered our quadrant?" 

You try to explain that you're lost, and that you need to get to the ISS.

"I can help you find your route, but first you need to do something for me. I've lost the keys to my spaceship, and we are stranded. I think they fell near your ship, can you look?"
