        You're very close to the South Atlantic Anomaly. The
        radiation intensity is higher in this region. It is produced by a dip in
        the Earth's magnetic field. The anomaly creates interferences with your
        onboard computers. If a satellite is hit by a high-energy proton, it can
        lead to temporary or permanent damage. We must move on!
